                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prometheus was conceived out of an analysis of the fractional reserve banking system. The fractional
                        reserve banking system as a system has almost perfect accounting mechanisms but is completely flawed
                        in its centralized issuance. This redistributes exponential debt to all its participants. Furthermore
                        its lack of real world commodities as backing make it impractical for measuring the value of goods.
                        Its value is only "hype". Nations have been scammed into virtually global participation in a scheme
                        to reposess the value and power of their populace through inflation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humanity exists in a post Bitcoin world. Currency can be created and issued by anyone who can conceive
                        of a token system. Therefore participation in unfair systems is only currently being supported by
                        ignorance of alternatives, ease of use, widespread adoption, and technical barriers. Bitcoin and
                        similar technologies contain technical hurdles that make it hard to participate in and unscalable for
                        all commercial purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prometheus aims at bridging the gap of the aforementioned barriers with the use of concepts drawn from
                        social networking. Time is the unit by which all things are measured against either implicitly or explicitly
                        making it the perfect commodity for measuring goods and valuing currency. A central bank issues notes
                        of currency as a promise of the bank to tender its value to the holder of the note. In very much the same way,
                        Sparks, the currency of Prometheus, is a promise of a member to provide value relative to time
                        to the holder of the sparks. Sparks represent -1 second of a member's time to be shared with
                        other member. Commitments of time to other
                        people is an interaction humans make with ease every day for both commercial and interpersonal interactions.
                        Now how humanity spends its time and what it spends it on is the only currency it will need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a social network Prometheus will provide the ability for members to connect and interact on
                        a commercial level and broker transactions. By using smart contracts as a mean of solidifying transactions
                        members can deterministically decide how their money moves at their discretion. Members will buy,
                        sell, trade, and fund products in any way they can perceive and represent in code. Tools like
                        Craigslist, Ebay, Kickstarter, and Patreon currently exhibit similar functionality but Prometheus' functionality
                        is determined by its user base making its potential completely open.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prometheus is developed in completely open source to ensure its accountability  and
                        to be resilient to change and the commercial needs of its members.
