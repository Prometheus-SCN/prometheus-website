                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prometheus was conceived out of an analysis of the fractional reserve banking system. The fractional
                        reserve banking system as a system has almost perfect accounting mechanisms but is completely flawed
                        because it only allows a privileged few to issue currency. This redistributes exponential debt to all participants in the currency without their direct consent
                        or knowledge for reason not under their control. Furthermore,
                        its lack of real world commodities as backing make it impractical for measuring the value of goods due to its depreciating value.
                        It is a fiat currency and its value is only "hype".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humanity exists in a post Bitcoin world. Currency can be created and issued by anyone who can conceive
                        of a token system. Therefore, participation in unfair systems is only currently being supported by
                        ignorance of alternatives, ease of use, widespread adoption, and technical barriers. Bitcoin and many
                        similar technologies contain technical hurdles that make it hard to participate in and have limitations
                        that make them unscalable for all commercial purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prometheus aims at bridging the gap of the aforementioned barriers with the use of concepts drawn from
                        social networking. Time is the unit by which all things are measured against either implicitly or explicitly
                        making it the perfect commodity for measuring goods and valuing currency. A central bank issues notes
                        of currency as a promise of the bank to tender its value to the holder of the note. In very much the same way,
                        Sparks, the currency of Prometheus, is a promise of a member to provide value relative to time
                        to the holder of the sparks. Sparks represent -1 second of a member's time to be shared with
                        other member. Commitments of time to other
                        people is an interaction humans make with ease every day for both commercial and interpersonal interactions.
                        How humanity spends its time and what it spends it on is the only capital that truly matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a social network Prometheus will provide the ability for members to connect and interact on
                        a commercial level and broker transactions. By using smart contracts as a means of solidifying transactions
                        members can deterministically decide how their money moves at their discretion. Members will buy,
                        sell, trade, and fund products in any way they can perceive and represent in code. Tools like
                        Craigslist, Ebay, Kickstarter, and Patreon currently exhibit similar functionality but Prometheus' functionality
                        is determined by its user base making its potential completely open.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prometheus is developed in completely open source to ensure its accountability  and
                        to be resilient to change and the commercial needs of its members.
